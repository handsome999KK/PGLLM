## Highlights

- **Training-free**: PGLLM is a **fully test-time optimization** framework for 3D point cloud LLMs, with **no additional training or fine-tuning required**.
- **Two baseline backbones supported**: We provide evaluation pipelines/models built on **PointLLM-7B** and **MiniGPT-3D**, making it easy to reproduce results on different 3D-LLM baselines.
- **Single-GPU friendly**: The released testing pipeline can run on **a single RTX 3090** for practical reproduction and deployment.
